# Vulnerability Management System

## Overview

The Vulnerability Management System is a Python-based tool designed to scan and manage vulnerabilities on target IP addresses. It utilizes the `nmap` tool for network scanning and SQLite for storing and managing scan results. This system includes functionality for scanning, storing results, fetching results, and clearing results from the database.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Perform scans on specified IP addresses to detect open ports and services using `nmap`.
- **Database Management**: Save scan results to an SQLite database, fetch results from the database, and clear results when needed.
- **Web Interface (Optional)**: Build a web dashboard to visualize scan results (requires Flask/Django).

## Project Structure

- `vscanner.py`: Script to perform network scanning and save results to the database.
- `database.py`: Script to handle database creation, result saving, fetching, and clearing.
- `fetch_results.py`: Script to fetch and display results from the database.
- `clear_results.py`: Script to clear all records from the database.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying which files and directories to ignore in version control.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-management-system.git
   cd vulnerability-management-system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **initialise the database**

    ```bash
    python create_database.py
    ```

## Usage

    python vscanner.py

## Fetch results

    python fetch_results.py

## Clear results

    python clear_results

## Notes

**Database Files:** The `scan_results.db` file should be excluded from version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.

## Troubleshootin

**No Such Table Error:** Ensure that `database.py` has been run to initialize the database and tables.
